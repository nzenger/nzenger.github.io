This project is a website I developed for a restaurant I was employed at over the summer. The website is a basic general overview of informations and services of the buisness and conveys easily accesible info for inquiring customers to view.At the request of my manager I used Wix and it's editor to create the website. It is not as difficult as developing a website from scratch with a computer language. But I feel that still learned a lot about web design from this solo endevour. 

It is harder than I previously thought to visually present information to a user in a organized and logical way. While at the same time remaining aesthetically pleasing to the user. But through trial and error and research I developed a template that I think conveys the buisness information well and at the end of the project became fluent with the editor. I am still making adjustments and changes on the side for my client so it is a work in progress to be completed in the near future.
