Operations between Small Satellites and sUAS (small Unmanned Aircraft System), more commonly known as the Drone Project, is one of many projects that has a focus in Aerospace Technologies. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is are more popularly known as drone. Drones have a simple aircraft system that consists of the vehicle itself, a ground-based controller, and a medium for communication. Drones have the potential software to be programmed such that it does not need control from man. They can also achieve great altitude and go a far range given enough fuel and command.  
	In the next month, the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory plans to launch a small satellite at the University of Hawaii. This satellite is an essential part of this project, for it will give us the means of communication between satellite and drone. The small satellite is being launched with the purpose of observing Earth.
	The drone project has worked on establishing a working drone, and preparing it for flight. Many parts break down so we have to replace and reprogram it. Most programs for flight control were already previously worked on, so we are tasked to keep the software and parts up to date. We are also tasked with coming up with ways for improving the flight characteristics of drone. We constantly think of new ways to accomodate for unexpected conditions such as rainfall. One task that is being worked on is having a 3D print model box that will sit on top of the drone, that can secure parts that previously sat on top of the drone with no protection such as the Raspberry pi. Additionally, the box will  prevent any damage sustained during flight and keep parts in position (so it doesnt fall off).
	 Before beginning the drone project, each team member was tasked with researching drones and aerospace technologies and their uses. One of the first exercises that Professor Nunes showed was if we were to change the speed of a four legged four wing drone, then which side would it lean on. Basically, he tested our understanding of drone flight and stability. 
	
	For our research, we looked at websites that specialized in drones and read articles, looked over the Matrice 100 Manual, and attended exercises including the MANTAS events, as well as collaborating with the rocket team. This project was started by Hawaii Space Flight laboratory and we got assistance from the lab in Portugal, there are three labs that represent sea, land, and space. Our drone team is the first experimental drone project to do this in the nation.
