Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
  -Problem: Students and student organizations need places to study and meet on campus for clubs and study groups, 
  but it can be hard to find available rooms on campus in order to fill these clubs and study groups needs.

  -Solution: An online reservation form and database system that records and keeps tracks of occupied rooms on campus where students can 
  check if a room is unoccupied anywhere on campus and then reserve it for any day or time that their groups needs if available.

Mockup page ideas
  -Landing page: will give a user a brief description of the sites function and purpose.
  -Login page: students login with their student id number.
  -Calendar page: calendar format that shows availability of campus classrooms with filters like specific buildings or time frames.
  -Admin page: page with admin privileges.
  -Reservation form page: form setup page where student fills out all the necessary information to reserve a room.
  -My reservation page: check on the status of forms submitted to reserve certain rooms.
  
Use case ideas
  -New user would login with UH username and password from login page, then can access calendar page to see availability,then fills form to reserve a room. 
  -User has an account goes to landing page and goes to my reservation page to check on the form submitted for certain rooms.
  -Admin goes to landing page and allowed to edit reservations and pending reservations on the calendar.
  -Students can't reserve a room for more than 2 days in order.

Beyond the basics
  -Use UH CAS Login instead of Meteor Login to guarantee that users are UH students.
  -Users have a reservation limit.
  -Map based interface to see location of rooms and will provide directions.
  -Users can provide specific descriptions and outlines of what they will use the room for and for how long.
  -When new account is made user must fill in profile information providing, class standing, major field of study, and campus.
